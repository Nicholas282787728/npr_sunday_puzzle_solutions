;; Bail, Nail, and Mail are three four-letter words that differ only
;; by their first letters. And those first letters (B, N, and M) happen
;; to be adjacent on a computer keyboard. Can you think of five four-letter
;; words that have the same property â€” that is, they're identical except
;; for their first letters, with those first letters being adjacent on
;; the keyboard? All five words must be ones that everyone knows. Capitalized
;; words and plurals are not allowed. What words are they?
