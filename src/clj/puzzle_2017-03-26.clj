;; Name two things found in a kitchen â€” one starting with G, the other starting with K.
;; If you have the right ones, you can rearrange the letters to name two other things,
;; one of them found in the kitchen starting with F, the other one probably found elsewhere
;; in the house starting with K. What things are these?
