; The word PANCAKE has an unusual property. If you remove its last 
; letter, you get a series of U.S. state postal abbreviations â€” PA, 
; NC, and AK. Can you name a major city and state that both have this 
; property? To solve this, first think of a state in which you can drop 
; its last letter to leave a series of state postal abbreviations. Then 
; find a major city in that state that also has this property. The city 
; and state names have to be different. What city and state is it?
