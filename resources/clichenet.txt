All ears
All for one, and one for all
All hands on deck
All hands to the pump
All heck (hell) breaks loose
All in a day’s work
All in due time
All over the map
All paled in comparison

Another nail in the coffin
Ants in his pants

Apple of my eye
Are you a man or a mouse?

Armed to the teeth
Around the horn

As beautiful as the day is long
As dense as a London fog
As far as the eye can see
As good as gold
As honest as the day is long
As horny as a three balled tomcat
As if!!
As luck would have it
As many Chins as a Chinese phone book
As plain as the nose on your face
As snug as a bug in a rug, To be
As tender as a mother’s heart
As the crow flies
As useful as a lead balloon
As useful as tits on a bull
As welcome as a skunk at a lawn party
As ye sow, so shall ye reap
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Ask me no questions and I’ll tell you no lies
Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country
Asleep at the wheel
Ass backwards
Ass over tea kettle
At the crack of dawn
At the drop of a hat
At the eleventh (11th) hour
At the end of my rope

At the last minute
At wits’ end
