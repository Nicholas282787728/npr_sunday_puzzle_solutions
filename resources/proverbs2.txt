Three wise men
Time and tide wait for no man
Time is a great healer
Time to spare
Time waits for nobody
Tis better to get things for free, than to work up a sweat
To deceive oneself is very easy
To err is human, to forgive divine

Too many cooks spoil the broth
Train a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not turn from it
True blue will never stain
True love is like a teardrop in Niagra falls
True love never grows old
Trust is the mother of deceit
Try praying Nothing pleses God more than to hear a strange voice
Turn the other cheek
Two Dogs Fight for a Bone, and a Third Runs Away With it
Two fools in a house are too many
Two heads are better than one
Two peas in a pod
Two things a man should never be angry at: what he can help and what he cannot help
Two wrongs do not make a right
Two wrongs may not make a right but three rights make a left
Under the thorn grow the roses
United we stand, divided we fall
Unkissed, unkind
Up to a point
Use it or lose it
Use soft words and hard arguments
Variety is the spice of life
Virtue is its own reward
Virtues all agree, but vices fight one another
Visit your aunt, but not every day of the year
Wait and see
Walk before you can run
Walls have ears

Tomorrow never comes

Too many cooks spoil the broth

Truth is stranger than fiction

Truth will out

Two blacks don't make a white

Two heads are better than one

Two is company, but three's a crowd

Two wrongs don't make a right

Variety is the spice of life

Virtue is its own reward

Walls have ears

Walnuts and pears you plant for your heirs

Waste not want not

What can't be cured must be endured

What goes up must come down

What you lose on the swings you gain on the roundabouts

What's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander

When in Rome, do as the Romans do

When the cat's away the mice will play

When the going gets tough, the tough get going

Where there's a will there's a way

Where there's muck there's brass

While there's life there's hope

Whom the Gods love die young

Why keep a dog and bark yourself?

Women and children first

Wonders will never cease

Work expands so as to fill the time available

Worrying never did anyone any good

You are never too old to learn

You are what you eat

You can have too much of a good thing

You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink

You can't have your cake and eat it

You can't get blood out of a stone

You can't make a silk purse from a sow's ear

You can't make an omelette without breaking eggs

You can't make bricks without straw

You can't run with the hare and hunt with the hounds

You can't teach an old dog new tricks

You can't judge a book by its cover

You can't win them all

You catch more flies with honey than with vinegar
You pays your money and you takes your choice
Youth is wasted on the young
